# BCA_Sensitivity
This project is an examination of the sensitivity of FEMA BCAs to housing unit projections that factor in sea level rise.

This project relies on previous work from a paper titled: Assessing Populaiton Exposure to Coastal Fooding Due to Sea Level Rise and can be found here https://github.com/mathewhauer/SLR-typology-replication



This work was originally completed as part of the statistical analysis for a master's thesis.
